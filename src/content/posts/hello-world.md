The main purpose of this site is to serve as a portfolio to showcase my projects. I also like having a place where I can send people who want to learn more about me. I long debated in my head whether this site should have a blog or not. Can I stick to write new content regularly? In the end, I decided to go for it because I really want to get back into writing. Mainly for myself, to look back, reflect, and document my life.

Over the next few weeks and months, I plan to write about my career to date and how I became the web developer and person I am today. I think that will be the most difficult part. After that, I want to publish an annual review every year to create an ongoing journal of my life—writing about work, business, and everything in between. 

I guess this will be easier. 

I mean, how hard can it be to publish one post at the beginning of the year?
